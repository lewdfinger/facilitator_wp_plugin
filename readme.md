# Rahna Facilitator WP Plugin

> This is my first attempt at writing a WordPress Plugin.

> The idea is to create a time-based dashboard showing the daily availability of Anesthesilogists at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. 
> Individuals enter their location, availability and finish-time at various times of the day. 
> The data is displayed on a dashboard to allow the Daily Anesthesia Coordinator to inform decisions about late-running rooms and relief.

> I based the code on and learned a great deal from Alessandro Castellani's [excellent YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l7JTie_6jM&list=PLriKzYyLb28kR_CPMz8uierDWC2y3znI2) .
